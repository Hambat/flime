                    <strong>Now</strong>

                <p>
                    I have to track payments, as well as send checks or use PayPal. It takes a lot of time
                </p>
                <p>
                    I have a huge time hole with onboarding freelancers and their tax information and then on tax
                    compliance and paying all the remote team.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Payment errors interrupt our partnersâ€™ workflow making us less competitive. We mature from manual
                    cross-border payments but have no global solution.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Marketing campaigns start with a huge amount of manual work for our controller to onboard dozens of
                    promoters and merchandisers.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="info-box primary-bg pdng-lg mrgn-l-sm flex-child text-center">
                <div class="info-box__title mrgn-b-lg">
                    <strong>With Flime</strong>
                </div>
                <p>
                    You can make hundreds of payments every week in five minutes, and your controller can do more
                    important work.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Handing it all to Flime obviously is a huge labor cost savings and automatically achieves complete
                    compliance with any local or regional rules.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You get accurate payment results offering your affiliate network the freedom to choose their desired
                    payment methods. Streamline payments to focus on doing more business development.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Onboarding, compliance and mass payments are on hand. Your accountant no longer has to vet payment
                    data and manually collect tax forms. This enables you to grow and scale.
