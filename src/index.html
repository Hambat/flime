                    <p>
                        I have to track payments, as well as send checks or use PayPal. It takes a lot of time
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I have a huge time hole with onboarding freelancers and their tax information and then on tax compliance and paying all the remote team.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Payment errors interrupt our partners’ workflow making us less competitive. We mature from manual cross-border payments but have no global solution.

                    <p>
                        Marketing campaigns start with a huge amount of manual work for our controller to onboard dozens of promoters and merchandisers.

                        <strong>With Flime</strong>

                    <p>
                        You can make hundreds of payments every week in five minutes, and your controller can do more important work.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Handing it all to Flime obviously is a huge labor cost savings and automatically achieves complete compliance with any local or regional rules.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You get accurate payment results offering your affiliate network the freedom to choose their desired payment methods. Streamline payments to focus on doing more business development.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Onboarding, compliance and mass payments are on hand. Your accountant no longer has to vet payment data and manually collect tax forms. This enables you to grow and scale.
